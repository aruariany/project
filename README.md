# Background
This project is made to help me finish my research as bachelor student.
Here, I did spatial analysis to find suitable location for the development of offshore wind turbine in South Sulawesi,

# Whom is this code for
- this project is intended for indonesian researcher who are interested to do similar research (some part of the code are written in Bahasa)
- this code uses pandas and matplotlib frequently, so I assumed that the reader will understand the uses of both beforehand

# Code
This project is done using python language, with the help of jupyter notebook.
There are four notebooks, each is for: 
- understanding data spatially using gdal
- wind data analysis, distribution fitting, using SciPy
- cost benefit analysis, following some equations from some research
- data visualization, especially using heatmap

# Files
the source data that is required to be able to run the code are:
- wind data from: http://indonesia.windprospecting.com. the download link is available in csv folder
- elevation raster data from: http://tides.big.go.id/DEMNAS/. you have to sign up first. go to BATNAS section and download the raster file for latitude:-5 to -10 and longitude: 115 to 120.
- other necessary files are available in csv folder

# Disclaimer
You can run the code without problem (I hope). However, it may be difficult to understand what it does without understanding the context first. The context is my thesis scrip, which is available to download here: (NA yet)
