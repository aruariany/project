# background
This project is made to help me finish my research as bachelor student.
Here, I did spatial analysis to find suitable location for the development of offshore wind turbine in South Sulawesi,

# whom is this code for
- this project is intended for indonesian researcher who are interested to do similar research
- this code uses pandas and matplotlib frequently, so I assumed that the reader will understand the uses of both beforehand

# code
This project is done using python language, with the help of jupyter notebook.
There are four notebooks, each is for: 
- understanding data spatially using gdal
- wind data analysis, distribution fitting, using SciPy
- cost benefit analysis, following some equations from some research
- data visualization, especially using heatmap

# file
the source data that is required to be able to run the code are:
- wind data from: http://indonesia.windprospecting.com. the download link is available in csv folder
- elevation raster data from: http://tides.big.go.id/DEMNAS/. the file is avaliable in the figure folder
- other necessary file is available in csv folder as well
